 QAQC Checks:
    1. Pick out a scenario in the map
    * Does the combination in the map match to a scenario in the s1 scenarios file?
    * How does the results of that scenario in PWC compare to the results from SAM?
    * Does the daily weather match?
    2. Pick out a reach catchment in the map
    * Does the recipe in SAM match the recipe tabulated manually?
    * Does SAM accurately pull out and add up those recipes?
    * Is the upstream watershed correct?
    3. Find a reach in each tier
    * Does the output from upstream reaches appear to be contributing properly?
    4. What's happening globally?
    * Any nan or zero values anywhere they don't belong?
